I commented the part where the e-mail should be sent with the contact information, cause didn't want to use my personal e-mail for this purposes(need to change some email configurations to allow python scripts to use it).

Also, was unable to add the tests for now. 


To login into admin pannel:

go to: localhost/admin

user: mirmedia
password: 123456
